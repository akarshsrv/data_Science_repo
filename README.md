### 6. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
   - Preprocess text, perform sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and build sequence models.
   - **Libraries**: `nltk`, `spaCy`, `transformers`
   
### 7. **Time Series Analysis**  
   - Forecast trends and seasonal patterns with classical and modern techniques.
   - **Libraries**: `statsmodels`, `fbprophet`, `pmdarima`
   
### 8. **Deep Learning**  
   - Train and evaluate neural networks for image classification, NLP, and time-series tasks.
   - **Libraries**: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `PyTorch`
   
### 9. **Big Data & Cloud Tools**  
   - Handle large datasets with distributed computing and cloud-based tools.
   - **Libraries**: `PySpark`, `Dask`, `AWS S3`, `GCP BigQuery`
   
### 10. **Model Deployment**
